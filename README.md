## Environment Variables

This app relies on a few environment variables for proper configuration. When you deploy, youâ€™ll be prompted to set these values:

- **ZAP_API_KEY**:  
  If your OWASP ZAP installation requires an API key, you can find or set it by navigating to **Tools > Options > API** within ZAP. If not used, leave the default value (`changeme`).

- **ZAP_ADDRESS**:  
  The IP address or domain where your OWASP ZAP instance is running. For local testing, use `127.0.0.1`.

- **ZAP_PORT**:  
  The port on which OWASP ZAP is listening. The default is `8090`.

- **FLASK_SECRET_KEY**:  
  A secret key for managing Flask sessions. You can leave the default or change it to a more secure, random value.
